# Medicare-Insurance-Premium-Prediction
The project aims to use the dataset obtained from Google’s BigQuery Public Dataset Repository regarding CMS Medicare. This dataset contains multiple tables related to different aspects of the healthcare system and their expenses—inpatient costs and hospital information for multiple years. 
Looking into the dataset, two business questions were raised: 

•	How do cost patterns vary for Simple Pneumonia and Pleurisy Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) across various Hospital Referential Regions, and what insights can be derived to optimize resource allocation and cost management?

•	Develop a predictive model to determine whether a hospital is likely to fall into the high payment category or low payment category based on its average Medicare payment, enabling strategic planning and financial decision-making.
